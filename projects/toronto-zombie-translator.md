# Toronto Zombie Translator
> An Apocalypse project. Placed 2nd overall. 

Between May 17th to the 19th, I was in Toronto for Hack Club's first ever Canadian hackathons. A 48 hour hackathons centered around the apocalypse, I was asked what I would need in a post-zombie-fied Toronto. My answer: a toronto slang zombie translator.

# How It Began
I'm obsessed with accents, especially the Toronto one. A dialect rooted in "nah fams" and "cheese," Toronto slang is like no other. If I were to survive the apocalypse in Toronto, I need some way to communicate to the toronto natives, even if they were zombies. Thus, sparked the idea for the slang translator.

The project can be split up into two different components:
1. Toronto slang to zombie
2. Zombie to toronto slang.

## Making My Own Toronto Pidgin Language
It would be hard to make a language from scratch within 48 hours, so instead I devised a pidgin language based off of Toronto slang. It's sentence structure is heavily inspired by latin languages, and can be broken down into 5 words: commencer, subject, verb, object, closer. The advantage to this pidgin language is that its structure is heavily uniform and well defined (unlike actual languages which have way too many nuanced anomalies)

| Commencer     | Subject   | Verb          | Object    | Closer        |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Whazzgood     | Fam       | Is            | Gyat      | Deadass       |
| Holâ€™up        | Big Man   | Runnin'       | Whip      | No cap        |
| Yo            | Mandem    | Link          | 6ix       | Facts         |
| Nah-fam       | Bredrin   | Holla         | Cheese    | Bless up      |
| Straight-up   | Plug      | Whippin'      | Slime     | Boom          |
| Real talk     | Ting      | Chirpin       | Yute      | Safe          |
| Wagwan        | Galdem    | Flexin'       | Ting      | Trust         |
| We out here   | Ends      | Catch a vibe  | Drip      | On god        |
| Slime         | Whip      | Settle        | Food      | Say less      |
|               | Cheese    | Run           | Watah     | You dun know  |
|               | Drip      | Skrrt         | Raps      | Clapped       |
|               | Water     | Swerve        | Gwop      | On job        |
|               | Brains    | Run up        | Block     |               |
|               | We        | Chop          | Piff      |               |

Through mix and matching these words, we can create rich, meaningful Toronto sentences:

> Nah-fam. Bredrin holla cheese, trust.

> Wagwan fam. Runnin' cheese on god.

> Hol'up. Big man whippin' gwop, no cap.

> Slime, we settle ting. Say less.

## Making My Own Zombie Language
> What would be the most likely way zombies, with decaying vocal chords, would speak?

I stipulated that most zombies would speak through a language rooted in musical grunts. Specifically, zombies can speak through varying the pitch of their grunts. A grunt with the pitch of C3, for example, could mean "nah-fam," while a G4 could mean "Ting." Here's the mapping:

| Pitch  | Commencer     | Subject   | Verb          | Object    | Closer        |
| ------ | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- |     
| C2     | Whazzgood     | Fam       | Is            | Gyat      | Deadass       |
| D2     | Holâ€™up        | Big Man   | Runnin'       | Whip      | No cap        |
| E2     | Yo            | Mandem    | Link          | 6ix       | Facts         |
| F2     | Nah-fam       | Bredrin   | Holla         | Cheese    | Bless up      |
| G2     | Straight-up   | Plug      | Whippin'      | Slime     | Boom          |
| A2     | Real talk     | Ting      | Chirpin       | Yute      | Safe          |
| B2     | Wagwan        | Galdem    | Flexin'       | Ting      | Trust         |
| C3     | We out here   | Ends      | Catch a vibe  | Drip      | On god        |
| D3     | Slime         | Whip      | Settle        | Food      | Say less      |
| E3     |               | Cheese    | Run           | Watah     | You dun know  |
| F3     |               | Drip      | Skrrt         | Raps      | Clapped       |
| G3     |               | Water     | Swerve        | Gwop      | On job        |
| A3     |               | Brains    | Run up        | Block     |               |
| B3     |               | We        | Chop          | Piff      |               |
